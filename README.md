## Overview

The Weather App allows users to get real-time weather information for any city worldwide. By entering a city name, users can retrieve the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The app uses geolocation to determine the timezone and local time of the queried location.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI with Tkinter
- Displays current weather data including:
  - Temperature
  - Weather condition
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Atmospheric pressure
- Timezone and local time display for the searched city
- Real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.x
- [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api) (free registration required)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes the following packages:

## Configuration

- Ensure that your OpenWeatherMap API key is correctly specified in the code. Replace the placeholder API key (`7818eb4cf493344d0df54ea29a34452f`) with your actual key.

  ```python
  api = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={location.latitude}&lon={location.longitude}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```
